1. **Database**:
   - A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of information.
   - It serves as a central repository of data that can be accessed and updated by multiple users or applications simultaneously.
   - Databases are designed to provide data integrity, security, and consistency, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the stored information.

2. **Database Management System (DBMS)**:
   - A DBMS is a software system that manages and controls the creation, maintenance, and use of a database.
   - It provides a set of tools and mechanisms to interact with the database, including creating, querying, updating, and securing the data.
   - Examples of popular DBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.

3. **Database Design**:
   - Database design is the process of structuring and organizing the data within a database to meet the specific requirements and goals of an application or organization.
   - It involves analyzing the data requirements, identifying the entities and their relationships, and defining the appropriate data structures and constraints.

4. **Main Phases of Database Design**:
   - Requirement analysis: Gathering and understanding the information needs and requirements of the system.
   - Conceptual design: Modeling the data using high-level concepts like entities, relationships, and attributes.
   - Logical design: Transforming the conceptual model into a detailed logical model, typically in the form of a relational schema.
   - Physical design: Translating the logical model into a physical database implementation, including the selection of appropriate data types, indexing, and storage structures.

5. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
   - An ERD is a graphical representation of the entities and their relationships within a database.
   - It provides a visual model of the data structures and the connections between them.

6. **Entity**:
   - An entity is a real-world object or concept that is represented in the database.
   - It is a distinct and identifiable item, such as a person, a product, or a transaction.

7. **Entity Set**:
   - An entity set is a collection of entities of the same type, sharing common properties or attributes.

8. **Relationship**:
   - A relationship is an association or link between two or more entities.
   - It describes how the entities are connected or related to each other.

9. **Relationship Set**:
   - A relationship set is a collection of relationships of the same type between entities of specific entity sets.

10. **Descriptive Attributes**:
    - Attributes are the properties or characteristics that describe an entity or a relationship.
    - They represent the data that is stored within the database.

    Types of Attributes:
    - Simple attribute: An attribute with a single, atomic value.
    - Composite attribute: An attribute composed of multiple sub-attributes.
    - Complex attribute: An attribute with a complex data structure, such as an array or a nested object.
    - Multivalued attribute: An attribute that can have multiple values for a single entity.
    - Derived attribute: An attribute whose value is calculated or derived from other attributes.

11. **Constraints**:
    - Constraints are rules or conditions that define the valid states of the data in the database.
    - They ensure the data integrity and consistency.

12. **Cardinalities**:
    - Cardinalities define the numeric relationship between the entities in a relationship.
    - The common cardinality types are:
      - One-to-one (1:1)
      - One-to-many (1:N)
      - Many-to-one (N:1)
      - Many-to-many (M:N)

13. **Participation Constraints**:
    - Participation constraints describe the mandatory or optional participation of an entity in a relationship.
    - Partial participation: An entity may or may not participate in the relationship.
    - Total participation: An entity must participate in the relationship.

14. **Keys**:
    - Primary Key: A unique identifier for an entity that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
    - Foreign Key: An attribute or a set of attributes that refers to the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

15. **Roles**:
    - Roles define the way an entity participates in a relationship.
    - They provide a meaningful label or description for the relationship.

16. **Nonbinary Relationship Set**:
    - A nonbinary relationship set involves more than two entity sets.
    - It is used to represent complex relationships that cannot be easily expressed using binary relationships.

17. **Weak Entity Set**:
    - A weak entity set is an entity set that cannot be uniquely identified by its own attributes and depends on the identification of another (owner) entity set.

18. **Identifying Relationship**:
    - An identifying relationship is a relationship where the existence and identification of a weak entity depend on the existence of a strong entity.
